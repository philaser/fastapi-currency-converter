# FASTAPI CURRENCY CONVERTER

A simple currency converter powered by FastAPI.

## Description
This project was in fulfilment of a coding challenge for [Shake.io](https://shake.io/). You definitely should visit their page!

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

You will need Docker to run this app. Get it from [here](https://www.docker.com/get-started)!

### Setting Up

Docker makes setting this project up as easy as ABC.

Just run the following commands in your favourite terminal and watch the magic happen.

1. Pull this repo to your computer from GitHub
2. In the root folder, run the following commands:
	```
	docker build -t fastconverter ./
	```
	```
	docker run -d --env ACCESS_KEY=165850929f3969f2e866 --name fastconverter -p 80:80 fastconverter
	```
3. Congratulations! You now have an on-demand currency converter running in docker.

To try it out, hit http://127.0.0.1:80/api/v1/convert?from_currency=USDt&to_currency=EUR&amount=100 and see how many Euros a 100 US Dollars can buy you. 

This endpoint takes 3 parameters:

 - from_currency: Currency code of the currency you wish to convert from.
 - to_currency: Currency code of the currency you wish to convert to.
 -  amount: Amount you wish to convert.

Alternatively(I really recommend this), you can hit http://127.0.0.1:80/docs or http://127.0.0.1:80/redoc to view the OpenAPI spec API that is generated by FastAPI. You can even try a few queries!

## Testing
To test this project, you will need to install pytest with the following command:

    pip install pytest

In the root folder, run the following command:

    python -m pytest tests
